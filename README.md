####Author: OsmÄƒtescu Antonina FAF-192
##Indtroduction:<br>
In software engineering, the creational design patterns are the general solutions that deal with object creation, trying to create objects 
in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. 
Creational design patterns solve this problem by optimizing, hiding or controlling the object creation.
Some examples of this kind of design patterns are:<br>
-Singleton<br>
-Builder<br>
-Prototype<br>
-Object Pooling<br>
-Factory Method<br>
-Abstract Factory
##Implementation:
Were implemented the following creational design patterns: Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton and Builder with the emphasis on the objects of type Furniture: 
Chair, Table, Sofa. Type Furniture contains 3 attributes, get and set methods and toString, which is used for output.
Singleton design pattern was implemented in CyberPunkFurnitureFactory, ModernFurnitureFactory and ArtDecoFurnitureFactory classes.
For that static attribute was used
